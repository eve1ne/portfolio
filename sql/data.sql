    'MedChecker is a mobile app designed to help parents safely manage medication for young children under six. The app provides clear dosage guidelines using 
    Clarkâ€™s Rule, reliable information on common medications, and a simple, intuitive interface. By addressing the lack of dosage instructions for children on most 
    medication bottles, MedChecker reduces parental stress and lowers the risk of medication errors, especially for families with limited access to healthcare. 
    Unlike many existing apps that require subscriptions or focus on other demographics, MedChecker prioritizes accessibility and ease of use for new parents. 
    In the long term, the app aims to expand to other groups, such as the elderly, while maintaining up-to-date medical data and strong security practices.',
